# Shopping-Cart-App
This Shopping Cart App is built using React and Typescript. It provides a clean display of items one could find in a typical online store. It gets this data 
from the Fake Store API. It features a loading bar at the top of the screen when loading the product information. One can add items to the cart by clicking on the
'Add To Cart' button at the bottom of each item. It also features a display of a shopping cart, accessed by clicking on the shopping cart icon in the top right 
corner. In the shopping cart display, one can view the items added to their cart and change the quantity of each item using the provided buttons. Beneath all items,
a total cost of all items in the cart is calculated and displayed.
